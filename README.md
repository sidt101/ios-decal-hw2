# WTF Keyboard: Hide What You Type

This keyboard is meant for sending sneaky texts to friends when other ones/parents are watching over :P It allows users to enter an encyptor number and dynamical encode the letters being typed so they cant be seen by anyone else. You can put negative values to decrypt messages sent to you! Go be sneaky!!





# Homework 2: Custom Keyboard

## Due
Tuesday, February 16 at 11:59 PM

## Description
In last week's homework, you explored Swift in the Playground. Playground is a
great place to test things out, but it's now time to build your first app!  In
this assignment, we will be exploring Xcode even further via the Storyboard. As
discussed in lecture, Storyboard is a powerful way to sketch out designs and
translate them to working code. 

Our app will be a custom keyboard -- think emojis, but with our own buttons and
interactions. Your job will be to fill out the code to successfully link up
interactions between the user and the keyboard. In coming up with your own
keyboard designs, be creative! We encourage you to create something that you
think is funny, cool, useful, etc.

## Instructions
1. Fork the assignment's repository from (https://github.com/iosdecal).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine (the URL should contain
   YOUR_USERNAME/ios-decal-..).
3. **Add to KeyboardViewController.swift and Keyboard.xib**
  * Required
    * A "Next Keyboard" button (done for you already, but feel free to change
            the image, text, etc.)
    * A "Return" button
    * A "Delete" button
    * Various input buttons (e.g. ASCII Text, Unicode, Emojis, GIFs, etc.)
4. Add, commit, and push your modified file(s) to your forked remote repository
